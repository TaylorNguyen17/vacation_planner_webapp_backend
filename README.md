## Tasks

B.   Create your subgroup and project by logging into GitLab using the web link provided and do the following:

•    connect your new Java project

•    commit with a message and push when you complete each of the tasks listed below (parts B to F, etc.)

Note: Any submissions that do not have a commit after each task will not be evaluated.


Note: You may commit and push whenever you want to back up your changes, even if a task is not complete.

•    Submit a copy of the git repository URL and a copy of the repository branch history retrieved from your repository, which must include the commit messages and dates.


Note: Wait until you have completed all the following prompts before you create your copy of the repository branch history.

> Initial commit

C.   Construct four new packages, one for each of the following: controllers, entities, dao, and services. The packages will need to be used for a checkout form and vacations packages list.


Note: The packages should be on the same level of the hierarchy.


Note: Construct a package named config and copy the RestDataConfig.java provided in the laboratory environment to the package. Modify it so that the package and imports have the correct package and import addresses. Copy the application.properties file that is provided in the laboratory environment into your application properties resource file.



D.   Write code for the entities package that includes entity classes and the enum designed to match the UML diagram.


E.   Write code for the dao package that includes repository interfaces for the entities that extend JpaRepository, and add cross-origin support.


F.   Write code for the services package that includes each of the following:

•    a purchase data class with a customer cart and a set of cart items

•    a purchase response data class that contains an order tracking number

•    a checkout service interface

•    a checkout service implementation class



G.   Write code to include validation to enforce the inputs needed by the Angular front-end.


H.   Write code for the controllers package that includes a REST controller checkout controller class with a post mapping to place orders.


Note: You do not need to duplicate REST functionality for each repository by creating methods in Java.


I.   Add five sample customers to the application programmatically.


Note: Make sure the customer information is not overwritten each time you run the application.


J.   Run your integrated application by adding a customer order for a vacation with two excursions using the unmodified Angular front-end. Provide screenshots for the following:

•    that your application does not generate a network error when adding the data

•    your database tables using MySQL Workbench to show the data was successfully added



Note: The screenshot should include the front-end view and the inspection console in the browser.


K.   Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## D288 – BACK-END PROGRAMMING
Welcome to Back-End Programming! This is an opportunity for students to develop object-oriented applications that can be integrated with relational databases, write code for object-oriented applications using Spring framework, and implements design patterns for object-oriented applications. 
FOR SPECIFIC TASK INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS ASSESSMENT, PLEASE REFER TO THE COURSE PAGE.
## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
For this project, you will be building your project using IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) in a WGU-provided lab environment. You will be working with an existing MySQL database and Angular front-end, which are supplied for you in the lab environment. You will share this project to a private external GitLab repository and backup regularly. If you wish to work on it on your local machine, you will also need to download the Angular front-end application and create your own MySQL database. Use the links on your course page to install the integrated development environments (IDE), MySQL WorkBench, and IntelliJ IDEA, and pull the project from the lab environment.  


## SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES  
1.	How to clone a project to IntelliJ using Git?

> Ensure that you have Git installed on your system and that IntelliJ is installed using [Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/). Make sure that you are using version 2022.3.2. Once this has been confirmed, click the clone button and use the 'IntelliJ IDEA (HTTPS)' button. This will open IntelliJ with a prompt to clone the proejct. Save it in a safe location for the directory and press clone. IntelliJ will prompt you for your credentials. Enter in your WGU Credentials and the project will be cloned onto your local machine.  

2. How to create a branch and start Development?

- GitLab method
> Press the '+' button located near your branch name. In the dropdown list, press the 'New branch' button. This will allow you to create a name for your branch. Once the branch has been named, you can select 'Create Branch' to push the branch to your repository.

- IntelliJ method
> In IntelliJ, Go to the 'Git' button on the top toolbar. Select the new branch option and create a name for the branch. Make sure checkout branch is selected and press create. You can now add a commit message and push the new branch to the local repo.
